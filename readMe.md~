## My first git push
### Pushing a markdown file

### What I had to do:

* git add . to add the file
* git commit -m to commit the file with a message
* git push to push the file

### When it failed I had to firs puss the master branch, re-initialize and push again, i.e.:

* git pull https://github.com/scovia/myFirstRepo.git master
* git init 
* git add .
* git commit -m
* git push

Then it worked!!!
